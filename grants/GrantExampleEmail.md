Dear Mr. Fiddlepie,

We have recently heard about your history with funding projects that support the environment. Like you we find it very important to keep our environment clean especially involving trees.

The goal of our project is to help others plant trees in areas around Milwaukee to support a cleaner environment for the citizens and other people in the area. We know how much you support others in working toward a cleaner and better environment. Like you we want to support the involvement especially including the planting of trees. 

In many cities around the world it is becoming harder to have trees around your home, especially since most people do not know how to plant or nurture their trees as they grow. With your support we will be able to not only help people find the right trees for their area but also help them plant the trees in their neighborhoods. But we can't do it without your support. 

For more examples of our work visit https://miles81923.github.io/urban-eco/ to see our ranking of trees, grant research and more about us. We plan to have the top 10 trees best for planting ranked to help the citizens of Milwaukee find the right trees for them.

Now is the time for you to donate to help our cause and our planet because without trees there wouldn't be much of a planet or us. Your support will help with acquiring trees and plant them along with buying equipment needed for the process. Donors like you can make this happen with your funding. Any donations need to be made by the 21st of november. With your help Milwaukee will continue to flourish with the beauty of more trees in its yards, parks and streets.

Thank you for considering our offer and we hope to hear from you soon. You can contact us at eh26071@pathwayshigh.org.

Sincerely,
Ezra Holman and Miles Meaux
