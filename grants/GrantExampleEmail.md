Dear Mr. Fiddlepie,

We have recently heard about your history with funding projects that support the environment. Like you we find it very important to keep our environment clean especially involving trees.

The goal of our project is to help others plant trees in areas around Milwaukee to support a cleaner environment for the citizens and other people in the area. We know how much you support others in working toward a cleaner and better environment. Like you we want to support the involvement especially including the planting of trees. 

In many cities around the world it is becoming harder to have trees around your home, especially since most people do not know how to plant or nurture their trees as they grow. With your support we will be able to not only help people find the right trees for their area but also help them plant the trees in their neighborhoods. But we can't do it without your support. 

For more examples of our work visit https://miles81923.github.io/urban-eco/ to see our ranking of trees, grant research and more about us. We plan to have the top 10 trees best for planting ranked to help the citizens of Milwaukee find the right trees for them.

Now is the time for you to donate to help our cause and our planet because without trees there wouldn't be much of a planet or us. Your support will help with acquiring trees and plant them along with buying equipment needed for the process. Donors like you can make this happen with your funding. Any donations need to be made by the 21st of november. With your help Milwaukee will continue to flourish with the beauty of more trees in its yards, parks and streets.

Thank you for considering our offer and we hope to hear from you soon. You can contact us at eh26071@pathwayshigh.org.

Sincerely,
Ezra Holman and Miles Meaux

### explanation:

To write a grant email the first step is always to add a website, address phone number or email so the potential donor knows how to contact you and where the email came from. The next step after that is to introduce your campaign and how the donors campaign relates to it as shown in the email. Next share a story explaining the need and who will be affected and make the donor the hero of the story by showing them their money will support and what it supports. This will make the donor know what a positive impact <b>THEY</b> will make. After this make a clear call to action including where and how they can donate to your cause and also include any deadlines for the support. Finally, end the letter with a thank you towards the donor to show gratitude. Finish it off with a goodbye and your name. Feel free to add a signature, seal, picture of yourself or any sort of contact info if youâ€™d like but it is not necessary.

### What should i use this for: 

This grant email and explanation should be used as an outline and help for writing your own grant emails. Grant emails are very useful for any project that needs funding especially ones relating to the outdoors. The email helps show waht your project is, how they can support, what their support actually does and helps convince themto support.

###	Key points of this email

Greeting:
The greeting is important because it makes your donor feel comfortable and it helps address who the email is for specifically

Campaign introduction:
The campaign introduction introduces what you actually do as an organization. Then when linking the donors campaign to your own it makes them think about how you are both similar in your goals making them more likely to donate.

Story:
This is the most important part of the email as it brings out the emotion in the reader. By telling the reader who will be affected by their donation it can make people feel sorry for those who are hurt without their support. Making the donor the hero of the story by showing them how their support would help a cause that is stopping these thing from happening.

Call to action:
This is the final step before your goodbye. This should state exactly what kind of support you need, when you want it and what their support will help with. The call to action gives the potential donor a clear ask for help for your organization.

Goodbye:
You should always finsh your email with a goodbye along with your name and a way to contact yourself. You can add other identifying markers if you want but it is not required.
