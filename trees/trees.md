## what does this data mean?
	Adaptability to Soil Types (0-10 points):
		High adaptability: The plant can thrive in a wide range of soil types, making it versatile in various environments.
		Moderate adaptability: The plant can grow in different soil types but may have some preferences or perform better in specific conditions.
		Low adaptability: The plant has limited tolerance for different soil types and may struggle to grow in diverse environments.
	Water Requirements:
		Low water requirement/drought-resistant: The tree can withstand dry conditions and requires minimal watering.
		Moderate water requirement: The tree needs an average amount of water and can tolerate periodic dry spells.
		High water requirement: The tree demands a significant amount of water and may not survive well in arid or water-scarce regions.
	Root System:
		Non-invasive: The trees root system does not disrupt nearby structures or plants, making it suitable for landscaping without causing problems.
		Moderately invasive: The trees roots may spread moderately but generally do not pose significant issues.
		Highly invasive: The trees has aggressive roots that can damage structures or compete with other plants for resources.
	Fruit Production:
		Desirable fruit: The tree produces attractive, edible, or otherwise valuable fruits.
		No fruit or neutral: The tree may produce fruits that are not particularly desirable or have no significant impact on its appeal.
		Messy or problematic fruit: The tree produces fruits that are messy, potentially harmful, or generally undesirable.
	Toxicity:
		Non-poisonous: The tree is safe and non-toxic for humans and pets.
		Mildly toxic: The tree may have some toxic components, but they are not highly dangerous in small quantities.
		Highly toxic: The tree contains substances that can be severely harmful or lethal if ingested.
	Lifespan:
		Long (>100 years) (10 points): The tree has a long lifespan, making it a lasting addition to the landscape.
		Moderate (50-100 years) (5 points): The trees lifespan is moderate and offers decent longevity.
		Short (<50 years) (0 points): The tree has a relatively short lifespan and may need frequent replacement.
	Maintenance Needs:
		Low maintenance: The tree requires minimal care and is easy to manage.
		Moderate maintenance: The tree needs regular attention and care to thrive.
		High maintenance: The tree demands extensive care and attention to stay healthy and attractive.
	Urban Approval:
		Approved for urban areas: The tree is suitable for planting in urban environments and complies with urban landscaping regulations.
		Not typically recommended for urban areas: The tree is generally not recommended for urban settings due to various factors like invasiveness or high maintenance requirements.
	Sunlight Requirements:
		Tolerates a wide range of sunlight conditions: The tree can thrive in various levels of sunlight, providing flexibility in planting locations.
		Moderate tolerance: The tree has some flexibility in sunlight requirements but still prefers certain conditions.
		Strict sunlight requirements: The tree requires specific light conditions and may not adapt well to different levels of sunlight.
