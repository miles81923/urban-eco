## What does this data mean?
	Adaptability to Soil Types (0-10 points):
		High adaptability: This means that the tree can thrive in multiple soil types.
		Moderate adaptability: This means the tree thrives in most soil types but may do better or worse in certain soil types.
		Low adaptability: This means that the tree only succeeds in specific soil types. 
	Water Requirements:
		Low water requirement/drought-resistant: This means the tree requires minimal watering and thrives in most urban locations.
		Moderate water requirement: This means that the tree needs a moderate amount of water and may require watering during droughts.
		High water requirement: This means the tree usually requires regular watering and will require heavy watering during droughts.
	Root System:
		Non-invasive: The tree's root system does not disrupt nearby structures or plants, making it suitable for landscaping without causing problems.
		Moderately invasive: The tree's roots may spread moderately but generally do not pose significant issues.
		Highly invasive: The trees have aggressive roots that can damage structures or compete with other plants for resources.
	Fruit Production:
		Desirable fruit: This means that the tree produces highly valuable fruit to humans and animals.
		No fruit or neutral: This means that the tree either has no fruits or it does but the fruits aren't appealing or beneficial to humans and most animals.
		Messy or problematic fruit: This means that the tree may produce harmful, messy, or deadly fruits.
	toxicity:
		Non-poisonous: This means that the tree does not produce any toxic or dangerous substances to humans.
		Mildly toxic: This means that the tree may produce a toxic substance that may be harmful to humans or animals but not deadly.
		Highly toxic: This means that the tree may produce a highly toxic substance that may be extremely harmful to humans and animals.
	Lifespan:
		Long: 100 years or more
		Moderate: 50-100 years
		Short: under 50 years
	Maintenance Needs:
		Low maintenance: This means that the tree requires little to no maintenance to stay alive.
		Moderate maintenance: This means that the tree requires regular maintenance but only for the tree to thrive.
		High maintenance: This means that the tree requires regular maintenance which if not done could kill or harm the tree.
	Urban Approval:
		Approved for urban areas: This means that the tree will not affect any local wildlife, buildings, roads, or other plants in an urban environment.
		Not typically recommended for urban areas: This means that the tree does not comply with 1 or more of the things stated above.
	Sunlight Requirements:
		Tolerates a wide range of sunlight conditions: This means that the tree can tolerate a large range of location and conditions in an urban area.
		Moderate tolerance: This usually means that a tree can survive in both sunny and shady spots but does better in sunny locations.
		Strict sunlight requirements: This usually means that the tree requires very sunny environments.
	Aesthetic Factors:
		High aesthetic value: This means that the tree is extremely pretty and very nice to look at.
		Moderate aesthetic value: This means that the tree may look nice but not compared to other trees that may be around.
		Low aesthetic value: This means that the tree adds little to no to the visual appeal of an area that it is planted in.
